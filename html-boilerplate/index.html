        <h1>WHAT THE FUCK IS UP DENNYS</h1>
        <h3>Basic tags and such</h3>
            <p>nesting is when one element is inside another creating a parent child relationship. The child element is the element nested iniside.</p>
            <p>One "parent" can have multiple children, therefore have multiple elements nested into one. This can be called a parent, child and sibling relationship</p>
            <p>Elements nested inside of one parent (siblings), are at the same level.</p>
            <p>It is recommeded to indent any child element by 2 spaces.</p>

            <!-- this one was made with the shortcut "ctrl + /" -->
            <p>There is h1- h6 for headings and p is for paragraphs, unlike headers there are no numbers that follow. </p>
            <p>you use em tags for <em>italics</em> and strong for <strong>bold.</strong> You can combine the two by nesting the two tags together like <strong><em>this.</em></strong></p>
            <p>em and strong give your text meaning outside of visual representaion</p>
            <br>
            <p>Strong tag is used for importance, seriousness, or urgancy </p>
            <p> <strong>Caution! Fire-breathing dragon ahead!</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p> b tags draw attention to a word or section of without conveying extra importance.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Link had <b>The Master Sword</b> and used it to defeat the dragon and escape.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Em tag is used to stress emphasis on a piece of content in a way that changes the actual meaning of the content.</p>
            <p>Further and further Link went into the cave. With each step, it grew darker. This was a <em>very</em> deep cave indeed</p>
            <br>
            <p>The i tag is used to convey a different mood or voice from the surrounding content. It's often used with foreign words or idiomatic phrases, technical terms, shp names, thoughts, ect.</p>
            <p>As he traveled deeper into the cave, Link thought to himself, <i>I hope Princess Zelda is in here.</i></p>

     use tag a(attribute) href="website">displaytext a>
    </p>
    <p>
      href will make text blue with an underline to signify it is a link. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        href will open a link in the same tab in the browser, but can changed with the target attribute.
        href will specify the destination, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened.
        To open the link in a new tab or window you can set it to _blank.
    <br>
        a(attribute) href="website" target="blank_" rel="noopener noreferrer">displaytext a>

        <ol>
          <li>rel attribute is used to describe the relationship between the current page and the linked document</li>
          <li>noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened</li>
          <li>noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it</li>
        </ol>
    <br>
        noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users, known as tabnabbing.
        Adding noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.
    <br>
        it is always recommeded to pair target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer" for better sercurity.
